/**
 * Partition:

User input for image choice:
a. Valid input .
b. Invalid input (a number outside the range of available images).
c. Invalid input (a character or string).

HTTP request for selected image:
a. Successful HTTP request.
b. Unsuccessful HTTP request due to server errors.
c. Unsuccessful HTTP request due to network errors.

Response as image:
a. Valid response (an image is returned).
b. Invalid response (an error message is returned).
c. Empty response (nothing is returned).

Subdomains:

User input for image choice:
a. Partition 1a: Enter a valid number within the range of available images.
b. Partition 1b: Enter a number outside the range of available images (e.g., -1, 0, 100).
c. Partition 1c: Enter a character or string (e.g., "abc", "@#%").

HTTP request for selected image:
a. Partition 2a: Send a valid HTTP request to the server.
b. Partition 2b: Send an HTTP request that results in server errors (e.g., 404 Not Found).
c. Partition 2c: Send an HTTP request that results in network errors (e.g., connection timeout).

Response as image:
a. Partition 3a: Receive a valid image as the response.
b. Partition 3b: Receive an error message as the response.
c. Partition 3c: Receive an empty response.

Test coverage:

Test for partition 1a: Enter a valid number within the range of available images.

Expected result: The program should proceed to send an HTTP request for the selected image.
Test for partition 1b: Enter a number outside the range of available images.

Expected result: The program should display an error message indicating that the image does not exist.
Test for partition 1c: Enter a character or string.

Expected result: The program should display an error message indicating that the input is invalid.
Test for partition 2a: Send a valid HTTP request to the server.

Expected result: The program should receive a valid response containing the selected image.
Test for partition 2b: Send an HTTP request that results in server errors.

Expected result: The program should display an error message indicating that the server could not process the request.
Test for partition 2c: Send an HTTP request that results in network errors.

Expected result: The program should display an error message indicating that there is a problem with the network connection.
Test for partition 3a: Receive a valid image as the response.

Expected result: The program should display the selected image in a JFrame.
Test for partition 3b: Receive an error message as the response.

Expected result: The program should display an error message indicating that there is a problem with the server.
Test for partition 3c: Receive an empty response.

Expected result: The program should display an error message indicating that the response is empty.
